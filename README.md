# 🎯 Project-Based-Learning-EC2  
### Ballistic Launch Simulation Software  

📌 **Academic interdisciplinary project** developed during the **2nd semester of the Computer Engineering course**.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  

Develop a **C# software** capable of calculating and simulating a **ballistic launch** to hit a stationary target.  

The program performs:  
- ✅ Calculation of the minimum angle (θ) required to hit the target  
- ✅ Request for a valid angle input from the user  
- ✅ Calculation of the initial velocity (v₀) needed for the projectile to reach the target  
- ✅ Time of flight until the projectile hits the target  
- ✅ Verification if the target is hit during the **ascending** or **descending** phase  
- ✅ Graphical plot of the projectile trajectory *(y vs. x)* or optional animation of the motion
